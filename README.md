# Multi-Modal-Document-Retrieval-System
Built a semantic search engine for scanned documents using Python, Tesseract OCR, and FAISS. The system extracts text from images, indexes it as vector embeddings, and enables natural language querying via a CLI. It retrieves files based on context and meaning rather than just strict keyword matching.
